			<h3> Gaming </h3>
			<p>If I'm not working on homework, or if I have lots of free time, my favorite thing to do is game! I love playing a plentiful amount of games, consisting of Grounded, Overwatch 2, Minecraft, Roblox, Binding of Issac, Getting Over It, and much much more.</p>
			<p>Below is an image of Overwatch 2, so far the game is brilliant and I love playing it even though it doesn't seem too different from its original.</p>
