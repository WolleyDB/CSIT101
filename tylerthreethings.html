			<h3> Tyler's Bio </h3>
			<p>I am a student that is getting into coding and here are some other hobbies that I have that you may not know! My favorite color is yellow, and I only drink water. The three things I talk about in this website are Gaming, Cooking, and Lifting, since I do all three of these on a day to day basis.</p>
			<p>I am not too creative when it comes to design, so I hope this all looks great! Also, as an image I chose to use rain, since rain is my favorite type of weather!</p>
